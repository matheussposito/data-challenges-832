    "* The dataset you will work on is the CIFAR-100 dataset. It is basically the same as CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes. The idea here is to get the best accuracy on this classification task. This is not an easy challenge and people are still working to improve the accuracy on this task with new models, as shown here [**`papers-with-code/cifar-100)`**](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-100). You can see that some models are still getting published on this model. This is therefore a benchmark dataset to prove the performance of one's CNN over another.\n",
    "* So let's enter this worldwide competition by building your own network, and maybe outperform existing CNN."
